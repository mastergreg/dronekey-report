\section{NS2}
NS2 is a discrete event simulator targeted at networking research. It interprets
scripts of network events at distinct times. These are written in the tcl
programming language in a plaintext file. NS2 has long been used in multiple
research projects and it has a large enough code base. Within ns2 there are
models for multiple network stacks and different mac layers which provide a
distinct versatility.



NS2 is by default a non interactive simulator. It parses the events script beforehand
and executes them at runtime. For our project we attempt to use it as an
interactive simulator, keeping it in sync with the environment simulator.
